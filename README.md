Build a simple GUI app that uses this api: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
Use the previous video to walk through building two tests for this simple app; 1 for a single beer and 1 for 10 beers
You should end up with a simple GUI app that has at least two unit tests injected into your fetch request
